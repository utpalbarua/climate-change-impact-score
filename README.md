# üåç Global Climate Change Impact Predictor

This is an interactive web application built using Streamlit to analyze climate and weather risks in real-time. The app uses machine learning models to predict two key indices based on input features:  
1. **Climate Risk Index** - Evaluates the overall climate impact.
2. **Weather Severity Index** - Assesses the severity of weather conditions.

## Features
- **Input Features**: Users can input values for the following climate parameters:
    - Temperature
    - CO2 Emissions
    - Sea Level Rise
    - Precipitation
    - Humidity
    - Wind Speed
- **Predictions**: Based on the input, the app displays predictions for the Climate Risk Index and the Weather Severity Index.
- **Classification**: The app categorizes the risk and severity into different levels (Low, Moderate, High, Severe).
- **Dataset Preview**: View the dataset used for training the models, providing climate insights.
- **About Page**: Provides details about the app and its goals.
